This project simply creates a plot of the history of my basketball statistics.
The statics include hits and attempts for 1pt-, 2pt- and 3pt-shots of my training sessions and free throws of my league games. An example datafile is saved as 'hit_ratio_data.csv' in this repository. 
To create the plot, simply run the script 'hit_ratio.py' using python3: 'python3 hit_ratio.py'
